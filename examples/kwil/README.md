# Introduction

These are example scripts to interface the Truflation data infrastructure with 
kwil (http://www.kwil.com/).  They assume the tables are in truflation data
format with date in YYYY-MM-DD format, value as a float (rounded to 6 digits),
and created_at with a datetime object.

# Installation

To install please request access to the private github repository 
truflation/truflation-stream.  Access to kwil is set up by the kwil binary.
